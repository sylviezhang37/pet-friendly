I love the idea of a café where you can bring your dog and enjoy a meal in a fun, pet-friendly atmosphere—it’s such a unique experience in the city.\n\nI had the chicken patty with black rice and lamb with vegetables, along with a refreshing apple juice. My daughter ordered a bowl with chicken, and she really liked it. We also treated Missy to a dog-friendly cupcake, which was a sweet touch. The space was clean and had a relaxed, community feel. You can tell it's a place made for dog lovers.\n\nNow, while I appreciated the freedom for dogs to roam, that part came with some challenges. A few larger dogs walked up to our table while we were eating and tried to get at our food. Unfortunately, not all owners were mindful of their pets, which made things a bit uncomfortable. Missy, who isn’t used to being around a lot of dogs, stayed quietly in her bag next to me the whole time.\n\nOverall, I’d definitely visit again—just maybe during a quieter time of day. If you have a social dog and want a chill place to grab a bite, Boris & Horton is a great option. I just wish more dog owners would keep an eye on their pups so everyone can enjoy their meals in peace.",

It was filled with both people and dogs, but more people than dogs. It was super loud in there and not a lot of space for dogs to roam around. There were a couple of people without dogs dining and felt a bit uncomfortable because my pup likes to jump up on the table and smell/eat the food, so I felt a bit uneasy because I didn’t want my pup to disturb them. There was also a big group that was celebrating a birthday, which was not the dog’s birthday but the owner’s (I just don’t think it’s the right place to have one, tbh). However, I did really enjoy the cold brew and cheese danish, but dogs aren’t allowed in the other room where you have to pick up the order. I felt uncomfortable leaving my pup alone in the other room, so you’ll want to have someone else with you at the time to watch your dog. My pup loved eating the pup cake, which they had a variety of along with pupper cups. On the other hand, it was cool to see my pup’s picture being selected to be hung on the bathroom wall. We’ll definitely be back, but at a time when it’s not too busy.",

The food is classic American comfort food like fried foods, fries, burgers, ice cream and so on so I wouldn’t say the menus us anything special but the food is comforting and seasoned well which is all I could ask for from a bar/diner type of place.

Another good thing is that they didn’t leave ice cubes in there. The drink was nice a chill, and didn’t get diluted by the melted ice over time. For appetizer I ordered crab cake. It was pretty nice. It actually tasted fresh, the crab meat was fresh, sweet and flaky. The aioli was also very nice, and tasted like a heavier version of pesto. I ordered their fish and chips as my main course. The portion was huge. 4 big chunks of cod fish. The batter was so light and crispy, and the cod was so fresh, juicy and flaky. However, the crispy outside didn’t last too long. The fries were just ordinary. Towards the end, it felt kinda heavy when I was trying to finish my last piece of fish. The staff was nice, but sometimes it takes longer to be serviced. Overall, it’s a nice restaurant. Probably the best fish and chips I have had for a long time.",

We shared the Bronzino, Parmesan truffle fries (always a fan favorite), and the brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious but I can’t say enough about Yoharelin.

We even made the reservation for 3 to be specific. When we got there at 9:25pm the receptionist stated that she won’t be able to seat us because they stop dinning for dogs at 9pm. We explained that the reservation was accepted and we had SPECIFIED that our dog would be joining us. She proceeded to state that it was an “oversight” on her part but she still wouldn’t be able seat us. We even asked if we could just put our dog in our book-bag because he’s very tiny and also well trained and he wouldn’t be an issue. She still refused and we unfortunately had to leave. There is NOTHING on the website or reservation site that states that 9pm is the cut off time for dogs to dine. In addition, we came so far just to eat here for our dogs birthday.

But for drinking ok tap beer and watching sports with others, it does the job.\n\nThen there's the food. Absolutely horrible. It seems that the food is served by a different \"restaurant\". Two separate checks for the bar and food, and different servers (bartender for bar drinks and server for food). We had their 20pc chicken wings with 2 different sauces, and the sauces didn't matter; the chicken wings were the driest wings I've ever tasted. Fries were also super soggy. We left more than half of the food, and when we didn't ask for the box, the server asked why and we told her that wings are really dry. She said she would tell the chef but not sure if one feedback would really change the food much. We ended up with $90+ total for 2 beers, chicken wings, and fries. I wouldn't go back for the food but maybe for drinks when there's a game night.",

I really liked the soup—it had a strong tomato flavor, but it wasn’t too sour, which was good.\n\nAs for the chicken bowl, I thought the chicken was a bit tough, though it was well-seasoned. Anything with avocado is always good, so the combo worked well. Will I go back? I’m not sure, but it’s definitely not bad either.",

              "text": "A typical weekend with friends usually involves them doing a lot of drinking without any care about what is eaten before or after. I’m not a drinker and being the unofficial designated driver, my time spent in a bar is watching them chug beer  or tossing back shots. All that changed when I came to this place. The entire food menu is vegan. I’m literally in bar heaven. The menu is large with choices and I decided on the Kentucky Fried barbecue sandwich which came with a large amount of fries. It was yummy. My friend ordered a burger and she said omg it tastes like a real burger and it came with a lot of fries also. So many fries that neither one of us were able to finish them. You can dine inside or outside but you have to order everything from the bar and that puts you in contact with a very cool staff. Lindsay,Nas, Steve, Vinny, and Danny were some of the coolest bar keeps I’ve meant in a while. Probably all that vegan food has their spirits nice. The price for the meals and  5 drinks was way lower then I expected also. I’m going to make sure I’m really hungry for my next visit to this jewel in Jersey City so I can try more then one entree. Oh and they have a pinball machine!!!!",

I’ve been coming to the St. Mark’s shop for as long as I can remember because they have so many different options/combinations that you can get. Pretty much anything goes in term of your toppings. On this occasion I got two dogs, one tsunami and the other a chili dog. Both were good. The diced pineapple and scallions add great flavor to the tsunami dog. The chili dog was good, even though it was light on the chili and could have used some heat. Nevertheless it was still very good.\n\nMost of my visits have been in the wee hours of the night; 1-2 in the morning. On this visit it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. On the weekends during the warmer weather they set up outside on the closed street and it’s a nice environment. So chilled and comfortable. Overall, if you’re in this part of the Village and you want a quick hotdog, then it’s definitely worth going to this legendary place. Give it a try because I’m sure you’ll love it.",
